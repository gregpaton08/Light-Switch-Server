* Add progress/spinner when loading/setting light status (front end) (possible with pure CSS? codepen)
* Replace on/off button with lightbulb graphic that visually turns on/off, displays current status
* iOS app and widget (separate project)
* research: how to install (?) so that production is separate from development environment
